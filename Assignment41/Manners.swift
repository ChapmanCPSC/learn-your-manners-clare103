It can save you from many hours of grief later.", "Keep negative opinions to yourself, or between you and your friends, and out of earshot of others.", "Do not comment on other people's physical characteristics unless, of course, it's to compliment them, which is always welcome.", "When people ask you how you are, tell them and then ask them how they are.", "Use a quiet voice inside, especially in places like restaurants."]
